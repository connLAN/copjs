already some good signs see there's


36
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,060
three big eagles up here


37
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,360
plenty of fields out here with mice and


38
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,560
moles


39
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,099

it's not

Frosty at the moment I think it's warmed


46
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,060
up a tiny bit


47
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,480
but I'm out in the marsh


48
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,360
apparently this week is


49
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,140
king tide week so where the ocean


50
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,080
floods this whole area


51
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,920
and high tide is in another hour


52
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,659
I do have rubber boots I didn't bring


53
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,060
them I brought just my hikers they're


54
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,560
waterproof


55
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,760
and I've got my 500 set up to my Nikon

z9


57
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,300
and I'm out


58
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,519
here to see the short-eared owls we've


59
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,920
seen two so far by we there was another


60
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,620
buddy that was here he had to go to work


61
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,720
it's great chatting with him


62
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,360
nice always to have like two set of eyes


63
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,159
and you could stand next to one another


64
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,019
and you can photograph


65
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,019
but the two short-eared owls were way


66
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,879
out there in some of the tall Reeds and


67
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,360
grass and Cocktails and they flew all


68
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,640
the way along kind of the shoreline up


69
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,900
this way


70
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,900
so we were able to kind of pan with it


71
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,019
and one of them went over this way the


72
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,940
other one went back over this way


73
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,640
thing to look out for I guess if you're


74
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,860
out trying to photograph short-eared


75
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,640
owls is that uh they have a shorter tail


76
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,560
so there's a lot of Harrier Hawks


77
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,420
there's like


78
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,859
30 or 40 Harrier Hawks out here and they


79
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:19,139
got a long tail and they flap quite a


80
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,600
bit so the short-eared owls are easy to


81
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,639
spot because they have such a shorter


82
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,600
tail and they are a little bit slower


83
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,360
with their uh their wingspan


84
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,280
so my


85
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,940
shutter speed is at 1 1600 I might go up


86
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,139
to 2000 or 25 100 to capture some of


87
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,479
their in-flight movements so I make sure


88
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,900
that I have nice tack Sharp Images


89
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,580
and I'm photographing it f 6.3 my ISO


90
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,220
right now is 1600.


91
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,180
is it actually what is my ISO yeah ISO


92
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,560
is 1600


93
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,479
wow so the Ravens are chasing the


94
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,600
short-eared owls kind of harassing them


95
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,280
there are so many like moles and mice


96
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,580
like even right where I am right now


97
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,520
uh you can hear them in the field


98
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,840
squeaking and moving moving around


99
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:27,860
some of the walls are huge


100
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:34,740
yeah the tide must have come up and


101
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,780
so that's a good sign that there's


102
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,460
plenty of food


103
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,180
I've got uh some some bars some food


104
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,940
actually in my bag here


105
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,860
and I just gotta watch it because they


106
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,340
will try and get into my bag or


107
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,720
just don't want them chewing through it


108
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,080
or something crazy like that


109
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,360
man it's chilly out


110
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,000
but it's exciting because uh there are a


111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,639
few short-eared owls they are active


112
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,820
there's so many mice out here that the


113
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,860
worry is that they just you know fill up


114
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,259
on on the mice on the food and then


115
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:13,320
that's it they're not active at all and


116
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,380
you can be out here all day


117
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,259
but I think with the harassment from the


118
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,660
other Harrier Hawks


119
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,180
Ravens and other birds


120
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,639
it's keeping them a little bit active


121
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,919
so there's a lot of chases and stuff in


122
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:32,100
the sky really fun to photograph


123
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,039
um hard to record at times moving around


124
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,660
so much


125
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,360
if uh they're nice and low to the area


126
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,240
it's you get this really beautiful kind

here in this tall brush


134
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,900
one so that the wildlife the birds


135
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,460
flying over and stuff don't really get


136
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,620
too startled or spooked by me I kind of


137
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,580
blend in


138
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,759
uh but two uh just because there's other


139
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,520
birders and hikers and that sort of


140

thing and I don't really want to be in


141
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,860
their shot and be noticed so the camo


142
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,440
actually is more for humans than it is


143
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,840
for wildlife because let's face it they


144
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,280
know I'm here they could probably smell


145
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,460
me they could see me from I think Eagles


146
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,300
is like two miles away like


147
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,720
yeah it's pretty pretty crazy

[Music]


150
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,520
and I've counted so far I think five


151
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,500
short eared owls


152
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,379
it's it's hard to tell because


153
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,300
one will land and another one will take


154
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,039
off


155
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,580
so there's two or three out this way and


156
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,419
one or two over here


157
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:44,940
it's just incredible watching them hunt

all the


159
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,220
all the hairier Hawks


160
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,839
have uh


161
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,700
kind of disappeared there is one that


162
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,140
I've seen but


163
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,420
over the last three hours there hasn't


164
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,580
been a whole lot of activity there's


165
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,740
some herons that are still plucking


166
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,140
picking away at some uh fish and a few


167
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,640
other things


168
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,720
and that's it and then it was quiet for


169
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,140
two hours just sitting here freezing and


170
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,000
all of a sudden


171
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,120
one owl another owl they're all flying


172
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,620
around some of them are chasing one


173
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,560
another it's just been unreal I shot for


174
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,680
probably 30 minutes Non-Stop


175
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,680
from video back to


176
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,720
taking stills


177
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,200
I will say with the Nikon z9


178
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,779
um I haven't tried the A1 or the uh the


179
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,820
Canon R5 but


180
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,459
the autofocus is better with the


181
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,399
firmware up update I'm at the 3.0


182
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,260
firmware update


183
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,160
but it still hunts if the the subject


184
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,800
which in this case is the owl


185
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,540
isn't like


186
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,420
clearly visible for the camera to notice


187
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,060
and to hold on to it so


188
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,279
um I feel like Sony


189
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,040
and Canon have come so far with their


190
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,779
autofocus that I just hope Nikon can can


191
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:13,440
put up some new out updates


192
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,440
um but yeah so stoked to be out here


193
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,320
I'm glad I went with the uh the fluid


194
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,279
head


195
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,940
so that I can pan and move and and uh


196
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,740
and get some great video with any


197
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,140
jerking moving around


198
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,820
I'm photographing now at like


199
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,600
3200 of a shutter speed


200
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,300
I was at 2000 but the owls kept on


201
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,519
getting closer and closer and when I'm


202
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,519
moving back and forth and and panning


203
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,320
with them I just thought there was just


204
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,060
too much blur


205
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,579
too much motion that was happening not


206
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,800
just the owls that's moving I'm moving


207
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,930
there's some shaking because I'm excited


208

[Music]


211
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,740
here are some of the tips that I've


212
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,779
learned while being out photographing


213
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,300
the short-eared owls once I saw that


214
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,160
there were short-aired owls in the area


215
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,620
flying around I picked a location that


216
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,980
had the best backdrop composition


217
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,899
foreground elements and I just hunkered


218
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,839
down there's no sense in picking up and


219
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,839
moving to where the owls are flying to


220
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,899
and from because the the space isn't


221
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,820
that large and they're going to come


222
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,560
back fly around


223
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,079
there is also more than one short-eared


224
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,140
owl so your chances of waiting and


225
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,839
seeing one fly by you is at a higher


226
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:10,800
rate


227
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,680
and I noticed other photographers kind


228
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,459
of walking to and from and towards the


229
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,079
short-eared owls they would see them fly


230
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,839
back towards me so I'd see them hike all


231
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,180
the way back towards me it didn't make


232
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,620
any sense especially if you're carrying


233
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,440
around a tripod and all your heavy gear


234
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,320
pick the best composition best backdrop


235
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,800
best foreground and just wait so for me


236
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,140
I don't want to keep moving around


237
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,660
because the background kind of changes


238
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,940
the height of the grass there's that


239
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,760
popcorn kind of flowers that I wanted to


240
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,260
get in the foreground and some of the


241
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,200
images with the short-eared owls as they


242
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,420
hunt so that was very important for me


243
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:59,000
is the environment shots


244
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,579
I find the best settings for owl


245
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:06,180
photography is first and foremost your


246
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,240
shutter speed seems to be king to be


247
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,300
able to capture the birds in flight now


248
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,060
the shorter owls can move quite fast


249
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,320
especially when they're chasing one


250
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,839
another or they're being chased and so


251
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,260
I've I found that when they're far away


252
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,040
about 1600 of a second was a great


253
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,320
shutter speed I'm sure you can go slower


254
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,220
than that but since I'm moving there's


255
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,800
there's the tripod and and there could


256
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,279
be shaking from wind they're moving I I


257
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,420
figured 1600 was was slow as I wanted to


258
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,720
go and then if there were mid-range 2000


259
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,100
and then closer then it's 2500 so I


260
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,860
would just roll the shutter and go ahead


261
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,959
and hope that I got some shots now I was


262
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,339
out there for the whole day so I could


263
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,560
actually check to see if things were in


264
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,320
focus so that was good


265
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,200
um you know next would be my f-stop so I


266
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,740
was shooting with an F4 lens and I try


267
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,100
not to shoot It Wide Open one for it


268
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,660
being such a shallow depth of field


269
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,680
afraid of missing kind of focus but also


270
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,839
uh it's a little bit softer I think on


271
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,480
the extremes and shooting wide openness


272
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,000
a little softer so I didn't go any any


273
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,660
wider than 4.5


274
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,600
I think the highest in my my sweet spot


275
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,480
would be F 6.3 but sometimes you just


276
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,700
don't get the light that you need and


277
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,940
then my ISO I had it on auto ISO so


278
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,180
shutter was locked in my aperture I


279
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,579
moved here and there at times depending


280
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:47,160
on the lighting and then my ISO kind of


281
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,600
just filled in the blank


282
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,180
so that's my camera settings


283
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,180
um a big thing was a tripod I was blown


284
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,480
away by by people that other


285
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,300
photographers that came down with camera


286
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,980
equipment that they're hand holding now


287
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,199
I have a 200 500 here and my camera body


288
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:09,420
and and so I could hand hold that for a


289
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,579
bit but I feel like you're you're adding


290
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:12,680
to


291
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,980
movement and strain on the shoulders if


292
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,300
you're going to be shooting all day


293
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,740
tripod is like a must so if you like

just hiking back I think I broke the mic


300
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,079
off of my camera


301
